            <h2>Scotland</h2>
            <p>Scotland is a nation that forms part of the United Kingdom. It encompasses almost one-third of the land area of the United Kingdom, comprising the northern section of the island of Great Britain along with over 790 nearby islands, primarily located in the archipelagos of the Hebrides and the Northern Isles. To the south-east, Scotland shares its only land border, which measures 96 miles (154 km) in length, with England; the nation is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the north and west, the North Sea to the north-east and east, and the Irish Sea to the south.</p>

            <h3>cities</h3>
            <h2>Edinburgh</h2>
            <p>Since at least the 15th century, Edinburgh has been acknowledged as the capital of Scotland. It is the location of the Scottish Government, the Scottish Parliament, the highest courts in Scotland, and the Palace of Holyroodhouse, which serves as the official residence of the British monarch in Scotland. Furthermore, it is the site of the annual General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. The city has historically been a center for education, particularly in medicine, Scottish law, literature, philosophy, the sciences, and engineering. Founded in 1582, the University of Edinburgh is one of the three universities in the city. Edinburgh is also recognized as the financial center of Scotland, ranking as the second-largest financial center in the United Kingdom, the fourth-largest in Europe, and the thirteenth-largest worldwide.</p>
            <h2>Glasgow</h2>
            <p>This city is acknowledged as the most populous city in Scotland, located along the banks of the River Clyde in the west-central area of Scotland. It is the third-most-populous city in the United Kingdom and the 27th in Europe, consisting of 23 wards that represent the various regions within Glasgow City Council. Glasgow is a significant city in Scotland for finance, shopping, industry, culture, and fashion, and it was commonly known as the 'second city of the British Empire' during a large part of the Victorian and Edwardian periods.</p>
            
            <h2>Stirling</h2>
            <p>Situated in the heart of Scotland, 26 miles (42 km) to the northeast of Glasgow and 37 miles (60 km) to the northwest of Edinburgh, this market town developed as a connection between the royal citadel, the medieval old town with its merchants and tradesmen, the Old Bridge, and the port. Positioned on the River Forth, Stirling serves as the administrative centre for the Stirling council area and is historically recognized as the county town of Stirlingshire. Stirling's strategic location as the lowest bridging point of the River Forth, prior to its expansion towards the Firth of Forth, established it as a crucial hub for travel in both northern and southern directions. It has been remarked that "Stirling, like a massive brooch, unites the Highlands and Lowlands." The city's designation as the "Gateway to the Highlands" has also historically endowed it with significant strategic valueâ€”the saying "he who controls Stirling, controls Scotland" is occasionally attributed to Robert the Bruce.</p>
