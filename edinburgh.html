            <h2>Edinburgh</h2>
            <p>Since at least the 15th century, Edinburgh has been acknowledged as the capital of Scotland. It is the location of the Scottish Government, the Scottish Parliament, the highest courts in Scotland, and the Palace of Holyroodhouse, which serves as the official residence of the British monarch in Scotland. Furthermore, it is the site of the annual General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. The city has historically been a center for education, particularly in medicine, Scottish law, literature, philosophy, the sciences, and engineering. Founded in 1582, the University of Edinburgh is one of the three universities in the city. Edinburgh is also recognized as the financial center of Scotland, ranking as the second-largest financial center in the United Kingdom, the fourth-largest in Europe, and the thirteenth-largest worldwide.</p>
