            <h2>Why Stirling</h2>
            <p>Situated in the heart of Scotland, 26 miles (42 km) to the northeast of Glasgow and 37 miles (60 km) to the northwest of Edinburgh, this market town developed as a connection between the royal citadel, the medieval old town with its merchants and tradesmen, the Old Bridge, and the port. Positioned on the River Forth, Stirling serves as the administrative centre for the Stirling council area and is historically recognized as the county town of Stirlingshire. Stirling's strategic location as the lowest bridging point of the River Forth, prior to its expansion towards the Firth of Forth, established it as a crucial hub for travel in both northern and southern directions. It has been remarked that "Stirling, like a massive brooch, unites the Highlands and Lowlands." The city's designation as the "Gateway to the Highlands" has also historically endowed it with significant strategic value—the saying "he who controls Stirling, controls Scotland" is occasionally attributed to Robert the Bruce.</p>
